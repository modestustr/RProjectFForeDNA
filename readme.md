The RCodes folder contains two crucial files, Degra.R and Accu.R, which include necessary commands for generating the required graphs. 
It's crucial to avoid modifying any other code files(importCSV and plotSave) to prevent possible errors in the operation of these codes.

In the data folder(for local), there are CSV files associated with the mentioned files, such as EgeriaDaphniaAccu.csv and EgeriaDaphniaDegra.csv in the data folder. Changes can be made to these CSV files; however, please ensure to update the file name and location accordingly.

After executing the codes, you can find the desired graphs in the "png" format under the "outputs" folder.

Upon running the codes, the generated plots can be viewed in the "Plot" Window of R Studio.
