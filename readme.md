The RCodes folder contains two crucial files, Degra.R and Accu.R, which include necessary commands for generating the required graphs. 

Data folder and file will be created after execution Degra.R or Accu.R scripts.

After executing the codes, you can find the desired graphs in the "png" format under the "outputs" folder.

Upon running the codes, the generated plots can be viewed in the "Plot" Window of R Studio.
